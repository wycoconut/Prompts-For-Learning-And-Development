## My Review:<BR>

### Google Certified Educator Level 1
- Study Guide has very good walkthrough of Google Classroom and Tools How To.  This is essential basics before any AI stuff.
- Be prepared to put aside 3 hours minimum for study & exam.
- Once you registered for the exam, you have 14 days to complete it.
- You will be tested in 2 methods : MCQ (many are scenario based, not "what is this" questions) and Lab Exams. 
- Also make sure internet connectivity is good as Lab Exams have a running timer. 
- Turn off all ad blockers on your Browsers just in case the exam lab's remote browser doesn't work for you.
- If the Lab got stuck with Service Errors, you just end the lab and start the lab again, it should work properly.
- If you did not pass the first time, there is a 3 days cooldown period, after that you can retake the exam.

### Google Certified Educator Level 2
- You will be tested in 2 methods : MCQ (many are scenario based, not "what is this" questions) and Lab Exams.
- Study Guide has plenty of good case studies of how to be effective in using the Google Tools For Education. Definitely sparked some hints and ideas on how to make the learning experience more interesting.
- Some special feature mentions in Google Workspace For Education Plus that makes life so much easier for teachers.
- Worth taking it to grow your skills as a Google Educator beyond L1 as it is full of ideas for teachers and reflection.

### Getting Started with Google AI in K12
- Its a good take on how AI can help streamline course content creation and have a few good AI enabled productivity enhancements for teachers if you watch the videos.
- I would personally still recommend going through "Google Certified Educator L2" for "engagement styles" with Google Classroom instead of "purely relying on this material" to be an effective educator.
- Good idea to have some hands on of all the tools mentioned in the material at least familiarize with it and try it with a few different topics and subjects and let it "sink in" a bit.
- Very useful links worth bookmarking : "Responsibility Checklist" & "AI Resources in Education".

### Generative AI for Educators
- Deeper understanding of how NotebookLM should be used (sources structure), fact checking and grounded information.
- Example of a Research Project with NotebookLM with citations.
- Example of Teaching Planning with NotebookLM, and ensure it maps back to the teaching guidelines / frameworks of the teaching institution.
- Useful Prompt Templates to build on top of, so that you don't start from scratch.
- Websites that has resources on "How to Bring AI to your students" safety and structurally

### Teaching responsible use of AI
- Great Resource for Educators to Use to Teach AI Usage for Students (includes Slides & Activities)
- Guided examples of hallucination and bias
- Use AI with Integrity
- Very good for learners who will have their first time experience with AI
- Prompt Guide with Examples for Learners
